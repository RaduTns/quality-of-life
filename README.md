A place to share my qol scripts that have aided me in saving a bit of time from time to time

## move_files
* As I am downloading tons of different files and struggling to find them later on, I developed this short and simple script which moves the files from a source folder to a destination folder based on the file type. It's also ensuring that 2 identical files won't exist 

## goods_on_sale
* On every Wednesday, I am eager to check the new catalog from Lidl so I can see what products are on sale. Can't say this takes much time, but it seemed fun creating something that will let me know which products, from the ones that I want, are on sale and when.
* At the moment, it's just a POC. Will further add better OCR techniques and filtration, will test on more catalogues as well
* To do plan: Mobile app
